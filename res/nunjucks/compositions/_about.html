  <p class="c-about__p">In 2010, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) adopted guidelines, known as the Affordable Care
    Act (ACA) or Obamacare, requiring health insurance providers to offer breastfeeding support, supplies, and
    counseling to lactating women. This means that you may be eligible to receive a free breast pump through
    insurance.</p>

  <p class="c-about__p">The coverage and patient out of pocket costs varies between health insurance carriers and plans. To find out what
    breast pumps are covered through your health insurance plan, complete our online ordering form.</p>
